# Customer Integration Overview

## Introduction

This document presents an overview of what you can expect to happen
during the onboarding process.

The outline of the process is as follows.

### Phase 1: Pre-Production

* Integration (Phase 1): Silent Circle and your team integrate with
  our SSO test environments.

* Acceptance testing (Phase 1): You test the integration, and once
  satisfied, send an email to the appropriate Silent Circle account
  manager indicating your acceptance of the Phase 1 integration.

* Validation: Silent Circle validates the test integration. To do
  this, we would need some accounts on your test environment.

### Phase 2: Production

* Integration (Phase 2): Silent Circle and your team integrate with
  our SSO production environments.

* Acceptance testing (Phase 2): You test the integration, and once
  satisfied, send an email to the appropriate Silent Circle account
  manager indicating your acceptance of the Phase 2 (production)
  integration.

* Validation: Silent Circle validates the production integration. To
  do this, we would need some accounts on your production
  environment, which you can disable once validation is complete.

## Integration

Silent Circle's SSO integration experts and your federated identity
management experts get together on a conference call.

We have found it to be very advantageous to have a screen sharing
session so that we can offer assistance if issues arise during the
configuration process.

* Agenda
    * Introductions
    * Establish that we understand the requirements correctly
    * Exchange information needed for the integration.
    * Add Silent Circle as a trusted relying party to your federated
      identity system.
    * Do initial sanity testing.

* Participants
    * Silent Circle account manager
    * Silent Circle SSO integration team lead
    * Your SSO expert
    * Anyone else who is needed

* Information we need from you
    * AD FS host's fully-qualified domain name
    * Federation metadata endpoint
    * Federation authorization and token endpoints
    * List of domain names with which your users will sign on
    * Credentials for 5 (five) test users with which we can sign on
      via your SSO test environment

Once the call is over, and assuming there were no blocking issues,
Silent Circle and your federated identity management system should
be integrated and we can move on to testing.

## Acceptance Testing

**TODO**

## Validation

Silent Circle runs through the acceptance test procedure and checks
the results on our internal systems. Once we complete validation,
the phase is complete.
